First attempt at a ruby gem to interface with VMware's vCloud initiative.

VMware's vCloud API allows manipulation of cloud objects using a RESTful API.

Documentation about the API is available at:

http://communities.vmware.com/community/developer/forums/vcloudapi

This version is based on version 0.8 of the vCloud API.
